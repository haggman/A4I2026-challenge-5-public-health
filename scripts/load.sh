# Headless fallback for notebooks/c5_01_load_explore.ipynb
#
# Rebuilds the same BigQuery tables the notebook produces, from a pre-staged
# snapshot in Cloud Storage. Use this when a Colab Enterprise runtime is slow or
# unavailable, or when one of the upstream publishers is not cooperating.
#
# Run it from the repo root in Cloud Shell (no chmod needed - invoke with bash):
#     bash scripts/load.sh                 # defaults to Fulton County, GA
#     bash scripts/load.sh 17031           # Cook County, IL
#     bash scripts/load.sh --list          # show available counties
#
# NOTE THE ARGUMENT. This takes a five-digit COUNTY FIPS code, not a state - which
# is a deliberate difference from Challenge 4. Santa Clara is 06085, and the
# leading zero is part of the code, not decoration.
#
# You still want the notebook if you can run it, and it only takes two to three
# minutes. Section 2 hands you the wrong answer and lets you watch it fail, and
# Sections 6 to 8 walk through the defects in this federal data that will
# otherwise bite you silently. This script gets you the same tables without any
# of that.
